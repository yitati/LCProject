 *

Given a matrix that contains doubles, find the submatrix with the largest product.

Return the product of the submatrix.

Assumptions

The given double matrix is not null and has size of M * N, where M >= 1 and N >= 1
Examples

{ {1, -0.2, -1},

  {1, -1.5,  1},

  {0,     0,  1} }

the largest submatrix product is 1 * 1 = 1.
