Given a singly-linked list, where each node contains an integer value, sort it in ascending order.
The quick sort algorithm should be used to solve this problem.

Examples

null, is sorted to null
1 -> null, is sorted to 1 -> null
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null, is sorted to 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null
4 -> 2 -> 6 -> -3 -> 5 -> null, is sorted to -3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
