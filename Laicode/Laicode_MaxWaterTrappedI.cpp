Given a non-negative integer array representing the heights of a list of adjacent bars.
Suppose each bar has a width of 1. Find the largest amount of water that can be trapped in the histogram.

Assumptions

The given array is not null
Examples

{ 2, 1, 3, 2, 4 }, the amount of water can be trapped is 1 + 1 = 2 (at index 1,
1 unit of water can be trapped and index 3, 1 unit of water can be trapped)

/*
 * at any point, the amount of rain water trapped is decided by the left
