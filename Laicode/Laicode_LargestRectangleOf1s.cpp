 *

Determine the largest rectangle of 1s in a binary matrix (a binary matrix only contains 0 and 1),
return the area.

Assumptions

The given matrix is not null and has size of M * N, M >= 0 and N >= 0
Examples

{ {0, 0, 0, 0},

  {1, 1, 1, 1},

  {0, 1, 1, 1},

  {1, 0, 1, 1} }

the largest rectangle of 1s has area of 2 * 3 = 6
