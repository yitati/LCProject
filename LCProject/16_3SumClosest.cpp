/*
* Question: #16 3 Sum Closest
* Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. 
* Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

* For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.

* The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
