/*

Given a matrix of size N x M. For each row the elements are sorted in ascending order, 
and for each column the elements are also sorted in ascending order. Find the Kth smallest number in it.

Assumptions

the matrix is not null, N > 0 and M > 0
K > 0 and K <= N * M
Examples

{ {1,  3,   5,  7},

{2,  4,   8,   9},

{3,  5, 11, 15},

{6,  8, 13, 18} }

the 5th smallest number is 4
the 8th smallest number is 6
