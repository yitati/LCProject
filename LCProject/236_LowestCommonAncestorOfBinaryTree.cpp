* Question: #236 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
* Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
* According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: �The lowest common ancestor is defined between 
* two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants 
* (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).�

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. 
Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be 
a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
