/*
 * EBMJ_CombinationAndPermutation.cpp
 *
given [2,3,6,7,8] array and target T, find the count of all the possible permutations
in the candidate array so that the sum of permutations is T.
For example, target 5, we have [[2,3],[3,2]]. return 2;
Follow up: combinations instead of permutations. like above example, return 1.


combination sum + all permutations
