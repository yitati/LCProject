/*
* Question: #274 H-Index
* Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, 
* write a function to compute the researcher's h-index. 
* According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: 
* "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, 
* and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each." 

* For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers 
* in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
* Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
* two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3. 

* Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index. 

* Hint:
* 1.An easy approach is to sort the array first.
* 2.What are the possible values of h-index?
* 3.A faster approach is to use extra space.
